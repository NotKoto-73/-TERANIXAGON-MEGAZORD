FoxOS Project Organization & Documentation Template
🦊 Project Overview
FoxOS: A meta-operating system built on NixOS that transcends traditional OS boundaries, featuring dynamic personas, quadrant-based architecture, and deep lore integration.
Core Philosophy

Not just an OS, but a meta-layer: FoxOS exists as a persistent, portable identity system that can integrate with both Linux and Windows
Quadrant System: North/East/South/West architectural divisions for different use cases
Persona-driven: Users are "personas" with swappable identities, not static accounts
Ephemeral by design: Home directories are temporary; identity persists in FoxOS core


🏗️ Technical Architecture
Foundation Stack

Base: NixOS with Flakes
Framework: Frostfall (custom Snowfall-lib fork)
Disk Management: Disko for declarative partitioning
Persistence: Impermanence module for ephemeral root
Boot: rEFInd (primary) or GRUB (fallback)

Multi-Layer Architecture
Layer        Description                                  Persistence
FoxOS        CoreSystem brain: flakes, modules, boot      Always persisted
Quadrants    Purpose-driven partitions (LUKS encrypted)   Persistent
Personas     User identities, dotfiles, configs           Persisted in FoxOS
Home         Ephemeral user space                         Volatile (tmpfs)

Version Control Strategy
Purpose          | Tool           | Reason
-----------------|----------------|------------------------
Public sharing   | Git + GitHub   | Ubiquity, CI/CD
Experimental     | Pijul + Codeberg | Patch-based workflows
Core workflow    | Fossil         | Self-contained, reliable

 🧙 Lore & Philosophy
The FoxOS Mythology

"They came from the Cold Ones... Out of the heart of the Foxcore 
Mountains, when all that remained were craters and broken flakes..."

FoxOS isn't just a technical system—it's a living mythology where:

Configuration is ritual
Modules are spells
Personas are masks
The system has soul

Key Principles

Ephemeral but Eternal: Systems die, identity persists
Modular not Monolithic: Everything is a swappable part
Declarative yet Dynamic: Define once, morph infinitely
Practical Magic: Every feature serves both function and narrative
